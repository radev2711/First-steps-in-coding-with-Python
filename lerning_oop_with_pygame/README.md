v0.0.3

Fly a ship in space, shoot obstacles, collect science points, manage ship's heat and buy upgrades.

No loading of graphics and no sound.

One example of runing .exe game with pygame sprites. Everything in one file. Mistakes were made. Windows Defender marks the .exe file as trojan :(

I wanded to do one Obstacle class and make 3 objects - big rock, small rock and commet, and then add them to the sprite.Group(), didn't work properly. Maybe in the next version (if).
