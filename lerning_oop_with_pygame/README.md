One example of runing .exe game with pygame sprites.

No loading of graphics and no sound.

Fly a ship in space, shoot obstacles, collect science points, manage ship's heat and buy upgrades.

I wanded to do one Obstacle class and make 3 objects - big rock, small rock and commet, and then add them to the sprite.Group(), didn't work properly. Maybe in the next version (if).
